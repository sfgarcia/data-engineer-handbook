## Spotify

### User journey

I started using Spotify in 2018. I loved how simple it was to find new music to listen to. In the past I had
Ipods and I needed to download more music if I wanted to listen to it. The switch to a streaming solution
was awesome, as I could listen whatever song I wanted.

Another thing I loved was the recommendations Spotify suggested with custom Playlist based on the genres I listen to.
This helped discover new artists I didn't know exist, but loved listening to them.

My Spotify usage pattern since 2023 has shifted because now I listen more podcasts than music. I started listening to
podcasts since the pandemic in 2020, and now I have some that I love listening to every week.

### Experiments

#### Experiment Nº1

Hypothesis: "Increasing the number of custom playlists per category will lead to higher user engagement and retention."

Spotify now supports 6 custom playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood. I would like to test if adding more
custom playlists would increase the time a user spends listening to Spotify (leading metric) and in the long time
this would increase retention of Premium members and thus impact profitability (two lagging metrics).

I would define three test cells:

1. 33.3% users with their playlists unchanged (6 playlists)
2. 33.3% users with 7 playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood
2. 33.3% users with 8 playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood

These test cells would help me define if adding more playlists is impactful in terms on retention and profitability. It would
also help clarify if the users start being saturated by too many playlists (in the case of 8).

#### Experiment Nº2

Hypothesis: "Sending notifications when a new episode of a podcast the users follows is released will increase the time users spend
listening to podcasts and the amount of available podcasts in Spotify."

I would define two test cells:

1. 50% users that don't receive notifications when a new episode of a podcast they follow
2. 50% users that receive notifications when a new episode of a podcast they follow

Leading metric: minutes spent listening to podcasts
Lagging metric: number of podcasts available in Spotify. If users spend more time watching podcasts, Spotify as a platform would be more
attractive for podcasts creators, so more podcasts would be available.

#### Experiment Nº3

Hypothesis: "Showing relevant podcast covers to users will increase click through rate (CTR) and the time users spend listening to podcasts."

I would define two test cells:

1. 50% users that are shown a static cover for every podcast (1 per podcast)
2. 50% users that are shown a dynamic cover for every podcast (up to 3 per podcast). The matching betweeen podcast cover and users would be
based on podcasts genres the users listens most frequently. For example, if a users mainly listen to politics podcast, the covers for most
of his podcasts would be related to politics.

Leading metric: CTR of podcast covers
Lagging metric: minutes spent listening to podcasts
