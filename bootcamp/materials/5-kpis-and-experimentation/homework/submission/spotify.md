- Pick a product that you love using (spotify, linkedin, etc)
  - Describe the user journey of the things you loved about it from the moment you started using it to your use of it now
  - Describe 3 experiments you would like to run on this product to see if it would improve the experience
    - You should detail out the allocation of each test cell and the different conditions you’re testing
    - Your hypothesis of which leading and lagging metrics would be impacted by this experiment

## Spotify

### User journey

I started using Spotify in 2018. I loved how simple it was to find new music to listen to. In the past I had
Ipods and I needed to download more music if I wanted to listen to it. The switch to a streaming solution
was awesome, as I could listen whatever song I wanted.

Another thing I loved was the recommendations Spotify suggested with custom Playlist based on the genres I listen to.
This helped discover new artists I didn't know exist, but loved listening to them.

My Spotify usage pattern since 2023 has shifted because now I listen more podcasts than music. I started listening to
podcasts since the pandemic in 2020, and now I have some that I love listening to every week.

### Experiments

#### Experiment Nº1

Spotify now supports 6 custom playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood. I would like to test if adding more
custom playlists would increase the time a user spends listening to Spotify (leading metric) and in the long time
this would increase retention of Premium members and thus impact profitability (two lagging metrics).

I would define three test cells:

1. 33.3% of users with their playlists unchanged (6 playlists)
2. 33.3% of users with 7 playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood
2. 33.3% of users with 8 playlists per genre, artist, decade and mood
